# WIWBBASIS
WIWBBASIS is a command line executable that retrieves precipitation and evaporation data from meteorological ground stations in The Netherlands, using the WIWB API.
Notice that the WIWB API itself is whitelisted since it is being financed by the Dutch waterboards. At this moment it can not be used by third parties.

In order to run this code also the source of the METEOBAS DLL (https://github.com/SiebeBosch/METEOBAS) must be present in your visual studio project.
